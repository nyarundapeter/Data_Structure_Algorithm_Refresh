## Data Structures & Algorithms Practice
<br>This repository contains my journey of refreshing and deepening my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
<br>It serves as both a learning resource and a documentation of my progress through various problem-solving challenges.

### Learning Approach
Each topic directory contains:

- Implementation of the data structure/algorithm in Python
- Common problems and their solutions

### Problem Sources
Problems in this repository are sourced from:
- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- Algorithm textbooks and resources
- Technical interview preparation materials

### Learning Resources
Key resources I'm using during this refresher:

- roadmap.sh (https://roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms)
- "Introduction to Algorithms" by CLRS
- NeetCode DSA course
- GeeksForGeeks

Progress Tracking
<br>I maintain a progress log in each section to track:

- Problems solved
- Concepts mastered
- Areas needing improvement
